#Problem Statement
The field of computer vision relies heavily on high-quality annotated datasets for training and evaluating models. However, the process of manually annotating these large-scale datasets is laborious, time-consuming, and often poses challenges in terms of scalability, consistency, and cost-effectiveness. Traditional 3D construction methods often overlook the richness of semantic information, focusing more on geometric data.

#Objective
The primary objective is to design a methodology using machine learning-assisted annotation to address the challenges of manual annotation and to overcome the quality limitations of models like SAM in a cost-effective manner.
